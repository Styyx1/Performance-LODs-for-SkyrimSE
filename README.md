# Performance-LODs-for-SkyrimSE
short explanation of setting up LODs that perform well and look good (subjective obviously)

# Preamble

- This is assuming you already set up your tools however they work best for you. I will only show the settings I find are the most efficent for me and look pretty good at the same time. I don't claim to know the best way possible, nor do I claim it's the 'right' way to do it!


# Step 1

## xLodGen
